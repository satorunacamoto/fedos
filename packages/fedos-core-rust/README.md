# @nostr-window/fedos-core-rust

The **FedOS crypto core** package boundary — the INTENDED future home of a
RustCrypto-backed WASM/FFI crypto core, kept as a standalone package so the host
app depends only on its *contract*, never on its internals.

> **Status: Stage 69 — TS boundary + minimal Rust crate SKELETON. No WASM. No
> cryptography.**
> This package ships the TypeScript `FedosCoreCrypto` seam, a permanently-inert
> `PlaceholderFedosCoreCrypto`, and (Stage 69) a **minimal Rust crate skeleton**
> (`Cargo.toml` + `src/lib.rs`) with **placeholder functions only**. Nothing here
> — TypeScript or Rust — encrypts, decrypts, derives a key, or generates
> randomness. The Rust crate has **no dependencies**, no crypto crates, no
> `wasm-bindgen`, no `unsafe`, and produces **no `.wasm`**. A real
> RustCrypto-backed core is a future, explicitly-reviewed stage that must FIRST
> pass the crypto test vectors
> ([`docs/crypto_test_vectors.md`](../../docs/crypto_test_vectors.md)) and ship a
> build manifest ([`docs/fedos_core_build_manifest.md`](../../docs/fedos_core_build_manifest.md)).

## What this is

A TypeScript boundary package. A real Rust/WASM core is meant to drop in later
behind `FedosCoreCrypto`, without the host, the Vault seam, or the identity
layer depending on any concrete implementation.

The host reaches this package ONLY through its own adapter,
`FedosCoreCryptoProvider` (`src/crypto/fedos_core_adapter.ts`), which maps this
seam onto the host's `CryptoProvider` interface (`src/crypto/types.ts`).

## API (`FedosCoreCrypto`)

```ts
getStatus(): FedosCoreStatus                 // { state, reason } — "unavailable" here
getCapabilities(): readonly FedosCoreCapability[]  // placeholder labels of intent only
randomBytes(request): Promise<FedosCoreDecision>   // generates NONE
deriveKey(request): Promise<FedosCoreDecision>     // derives NONE
encrypt(request): Promise<FedosCoreDecision>       // encrypts NOTHING
decrypt(request): Promise<FedosCoreDecision>       // decrypts NOTHING
```

Every operation resolves to a non-sensitive `FedosCoreDecision`
(`{ allowed, state, reason }`) — never throws, and carries **no output/bytes
field** because nothing is computed. `PlaceholderFedosCoreCrypto` /
`createFedosCoreCrypto()` are the safe, always-`unavailable` default.

## Hard guardrails (this stage implements NONE of these)

- No HKDF / Argon2 / any KDF, no key derivation
- No AEAD, no ChaCha20-Poly1305 / XChaCha20-Poly1305, no AES-GCM, no encrypt/decrypt
- No CSPRNG / random generation
- No BIP39 / BIP32
- No NIP-44
- No zeroize
- No WebAuthn / passkey, no Secure Enclave, no Apple/Google enclave integration
- Handles no secret bytes: requests carry OPAQUE, non-secret handles/labels only

## No secrets on this boundary

Requests carry only opaque handles (`keyRef`, `plaintextRef`, `ciphertextRef`)
and non-secret labels (`purpose`, `aad`, algorithm/KDF names) — never raw key
material, seeds, passphrases, plaintext, or ciphertext. A future Rust core would
hold secret bytes internally on its own side and resolve handles there. This
boundary neither transports nor stores secret material, and makes **no**
security/confidentiality/"safe storage" guarantee.

## Future replacement point

When a real core lands, it implements `FedosCoreCrypto` here (Rust compiled to
WASM, or an FFI module) and is selected in place of
`PlaceholderFedosCoreCrypto`. The host adapter and the `CryptoProvider`
interface do not change. It is **not** wired into the runtime or the Worker in
this stage.

```
packages/fedos-core-rust
  Cargo.toml     — Rust crate skeleton (v0.0.0, edition 2021, rlib, NO dependencies) — Stage 69
  src/index.ts   — entry point: FedosCoreCrypto seam + PlaceholderFedosCoreCrypto / createFedosCoreCrypto
  src/types.ts   — FedosCoreCrypto contract, status/decision/capability, request shapes (imports nothing)
  src/wasm_loader.ts — WASM loader seam (Noop/Placeholder) — loads nothing (Stage 63)
  src/lib.rs     — Rust placeholder API (status/capabilities + *_placeholder fns) — NO crypto, NO unsafe, NO WASM (Stage 69)
```

The Rust `src/lib.rs` mirrors the TS `FedosCoreCrypto` shape with placeholder-only
functions (`fedos_core_status`, `fedos_core_capabilities`,
`random_bytes_placeholder`, `derive_key_placeholder`, `encrypt_placeholder`,
`decrypt_placeholder`) — each returns an `Unavailable` / `Placeholder`
`FedosCoreStatus` and runs no cryptography. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` bans
`unsafe`. No WASM target is declared; nothing compiles to `.wasm`.
